# Inverted Pendulum

This project is a first look into controlling an inverted Pendulum using the Gymnasium Environemt by Farama-Foundation.
The pendulum starts in randomized state and is then controlled by a PD-Controller. Meanwhile random torque disturbances are being forced upon the pendulum. If terminated or truncated, the whole environment is being resetted.

### Note on Video Recording

Earlier versions of this project included a video recording feature using `moviepy` and `ffmpeg`.  
To improve cross-platform compatibility and simplify setup, this feature has been removed.

As a result:
- The animation now runs live via `render_mode="human"`.
- Users on Windows, macOS, and Linux can view it directly with no extra dependencies.
- Some comments and code snippets related to video export remain in the source for reference.

## Demo

```bash
Running PD control with disturbances â€” press Ctrl+C to stop.
Disturbance torque: 2.16
Environment reset...
Saved episode 0
Disturbance torque: 2.78
Environment reset...
